Frijoles Charros

**adapted from Rick Bayless' Everyday Mexican**

  - 1 lbs black beans
  - 1 lbs bacon, cut into chunky lardons
  - 2-3 big sprigs epazote
  - 3 cloves of garlic, smashed, removed from skin
  - 3-4 cloves, finely minced
  - 1-2 jalapenos, finely minced
  - 1 can chipotles en adobo, chopped fine w/ sauce from can
  - 1 onion, halved
  - 1 onion, finely chopped
  - 1-2 carrots, roughly chopped
  - 1-2 celery stalks, roughly chopped

  (1) Overnight, soak 1 lbs of black beans in enough salted water that when the beans expand they won’t end up higher than the level of the water.
  (2) Rinse the beans in a colander, put them in a pot and add clean water, well more than enough to cover. Season LIBERALLY. Beans love salt.
  (3) While bringing the pot to a boil, add halved onion, carrots, celery, smashed garlic, & epazote
  (4) Knock it down to a simmer. Cook until al dente. Cook time can vary a lot. Count on at least 30 min. Do lots of taste tests.
  (5) When you’re pretty sure the beans are finishing up, cook bacon in a large pan (it’ll eventually have all the beans in it).
  (6) Once bacon is crisping up nicely, get the heat to medium and add chopped onion to the pan. Stir and cook until softened somewhat.
  (7) Add minced garlic and jalapeños. Cook until everything is well integrated and fragrant.
  (8) Add minced chipotles en adobo w/ sauce. Stir in and cook until integrated.
  (9) Add the cooked beans. Bring up to a boil. While pan heats up, roughly SMOOSH beans with a potato masher or the back of a spoon. Don’t hurt yourself or something.
  (10) Knock down to a simmer, cook until you get to the consistency you’re looking for. Keep in mind the beans will tighten up a lot once they’re off the heat.
